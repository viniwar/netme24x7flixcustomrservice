            <h1>When I click on the netflix customer service app, it does not open</h1>
            <p>When you’re having trouble with your Netflix app, the issue might be due to a network connectivity problem, a device problem, or an issue with your Netflix app or account. You can try these fixes in order: First, try fully exiting the Netflix app and closing any other application running in the background, then restart your device. After your device is back on, try relaunching Netflix. If that doesn’t work, check to make sure both your Netflix app and your device’s software are up-to-date. Lastly, try disconnecting and then reconnecting to your internet. If none of these steps work, there could be a more specific issue at play.</p>

            <h1>Why am I being asked who I want to add to my account? I am the only one who uses my account on tv device and iPad device.</h1>
            <p>When you log into Netflix, it asks who’s watching to help personalize your viewing experience. Each profile gets its own personalized Netflix experience, with unique recommendations, watching history, ratings, and My List. If you’re the only one using your account, you can simply select your profile each time. Despite being the sole user, the platform still offers you the option to add more profiles (up to five), which is useful if ever you wish to share your account with family members or friends in the future. So, you can ignore this prompt if you’re not interested in adding more users.</p>

            <h1>Waiting for new credit card by mail</h1>
            <p>If your previous credit card is no longer valid and you’re waiting for a new one, you might run into issues with your Netflix payment. Don’t worry, your Netflix service will remain active for the time being. If the payment fails, Netflix tries again after a few days. Once you receive your new card, you can update your payment information in your Netflix account under the “Account” section. There, you can select “Update payment info” to enter your new card details. You can do this using any device that has internet and can access Netflix.</p>

            <h1>Netflix is charging me for nothing</h1>

If you think there’s been a mistake, check to see if you have any active subscriptions on your account. If there are no active subscriptions but you’re still being charged, it’s possible that someone else is using your account without your consent. Always remember to keep your Netflix login details private.
